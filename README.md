# FireAlarmProject

This system is designed to detect the presence of fire in a building. It uses an Arduino board to control various components, including an Infrared (IR) sensor and a buzzer. When the IR sensor detects an increase in IR radiation, indicative of a fire, it triggers the buzzer, emitting a loud alarm sound. The system can also be integrated with an automatic sprinkler system or fire suppression system, to quickly extinguish the fire.
The system is user-friendly and cost-effective, making it a great solution for home or small business applications. The Arduino board provides a platform for customization and expansion, allowing you to add additional sensors, alarms, or interfaces as needed. With its ability to detect fires quickly and accurately using IR sensors and emit an alarm sound with a buzzer, this fire detection system using Arduino helps to ensure the safety of your building and its occupants.
In this repository is added the code for programming Arduino(.ino), the schematic in KiCad of Hardware(Fire Alarm folder) and two videos of system test.
